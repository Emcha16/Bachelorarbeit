Discourses of Energy-Saving Delay - Bachelor Thesis at Öko-Institut 

This repository contains the code and data for the bachelor thesis 'Discourses of Energy-Saving Delay'. This thesis analyses how narratives around energy-saving delay were constructed on Twitter during the energy crisis 2022-2023 in Germany. Thereby, narratives as well as engagement metrics are analysed and portrayed, sentiment distribution illustrated and recurring linguistic patterns in word clouds visualised.

Overview
The bachelor thesis aims to understand the narratives underlying energy-saving obstruction behaviour. Therefore, Twitter data is analysed to identify and visualise discourses related to energy-saving delay. The development of categories and the following categorisation was performed manually beforehand. The categories are based and inspired by the 'Discourses of Climate Delay' framework by Lamb et al. (2020).
The main objectives in the thesis are:
- to classify tweets according to delay narrative categories
- to explore engagement patterns and dominant themes
- to provide insights for future communication strategies to improve public acceptance of energy-saving and transition

The core analysis is implemented in the Visual Studio Code "Discourses_of_energy_delay.ipynb"
